I'm a Master of Computer Science student in [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en) with Data Science and Technology specialization. My major interests are machine learning, visual intelligence, and data engineering.

It's a pleasure to have you here. You might find several projects I have worked on here as well as articles about intriguing topics. I would be glad to have discussion or a small chat with you. Cheers!
